# Wallet App

In this mobile app I used React Native with Expo and TypeScript.

## Frontend

- Contains 3 diferent screens: Welcome, Home and Card.
- Welcome: Greetings and a button to start the app.
- Home: Displays all your cards, your last transactions and a transfer menu.
- Card: It will display one specific card that matches your selection on the Home screen. 

## Setup
- In this repo, go to 'wallet-app' folder and do a 'npm i' && 'npm start'.
- Being an Expo app, you can scan the QR code to open the code in your Expo app.
